## Consumer Driven Contract - Service Side

This project illustrates using Spring Cloud Contract's verifier to verify a service's contract is being upheld.

This verification is performed based upon specific input and output scripts that define the service's expected behaviour. During the build process, JUnit tests are automatically generated based on these 'service contracts' and these are run against the service's controller code.

If the build is successful, these definitions can then be packaged up and placed into the local Maven repository for use by our service's various consumers.

> The `cdc-microservice-consumer` is one such example of a 'service consumer'.

### Setting up the Project

The first step is to setup the build script and bring in the Spring Cloud Contract dependencies. I'm not going to pring the whole `build.gradle` file here but the highlights include...

1. The plugins being applied...

  ```groovy
  apply plugin: 'spring-cloud-contract'
  apply plugin: 'maven-publish'
  ```

  This add's to Gradle the capability to publish the service consumer-driven-contract definitions to the local Maven repository.

2. The test's base-class package...

  ```groovy
  contracts {
      packageWithBaseClasses = 'io.pivotalservices'
  }
  ```

  It's in this package in the folder `src/test/java/io/pivotalservices` that I have included the mandatory base class for the auto generated tests.

3. Add the testing base-class.

  With Spring Cloud Contract, additional JUnit tests are auto-generated for you based on the contracts that you supply. Each of those auto generated tests needs to extend a base class that defined the controller under test. This base class is as follows in this example...

  ```java
  package io.pivotalservices;

  import com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
  import io.pivotalservices.fraud.FraudDetectionController;
  import org.junit.Before;

  public class ContractVerifierBase {

      @Before
      public void setup() {
          RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new FraudDetectionController()); // Set up the programmable Mock for the Controller.
      }
  }
  ```

  You could run into difficulties if you don't provide a base class, or if this class is in the wrong place, or if it has the wrong name, or if it's mixed in with other classes. I'll tell you how to check everything is working later.

### Setup the Contracts

Once the project is setup, it's time to add some contracts. The service contracts are located in the folder `src/test/resources/contracts`. These contracts are simple 'Groovy' documents that look similar to this:-

```groovy
package contracts

org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    request {
        method 'PUT'
        url '/fraudcheck'
        body("""
    {
      "clientId":"1234567890",
      "loanAmount":99999
    }
    """)
        headers {
            header('Content-Type', 'application/vnd.fraud.v1+json')
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body("""
  {
    "fraudCheckStatus": "FRAUD",
    "resultText": "Amount too high"
  }
  """)
        headers {
            header('Content-Type': 'application/vnd.fraud.v1+json;charset=UTF-8')
        }
    }
}
```

They describe the inputs and the outputs (requests and responses) expected when interacting with the service implemented by the `FraudDetectionController` (which is a Spring Boot microservice whose source code can be found in the `src/main/java/io/pivotalservices/fraud` folder).

### Build and Test the Service logic

To generate and run the Consumer Driven Contract test verifier, execute the following:-

````bash
$ gradle clean build
````

When you do this, a suite of Java tests are auto generated as part of the build. You can see these auto generated tests in the folder `build/generated-test-sources`. You should go and examine these tests each time. If the process didn't work for some reason, the generated-test-sources folder may be empty and you won't necessarily have been alerted to their loss.

When successfully auto-generated, the tests produced look something like this:-

```java
@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
    MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
            .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
            .body("{\"clientId\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
    ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
            .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
    assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
    assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).isEqualTo("application/vnd.fraud.v1+json;charset=UTF-8");
    // and:
    DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
    assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("resultText").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
    assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("fraudCheckStatus").isEqualTo("FRAUD");
}
```

You can see that the code produced by the code generator mimics the Groovy contract that we had defined earlier. These tests are executed as part of the `build` process. If the tests fail, the build will fail in the usual way.

### Exporting the contracts

If the build and test process was successful, it's time to export the contracts and the service's behavioral definitions to Maven.

Before you start, check the `build` folder again. Within it you should have a `stubs` folder containing `contracts` and `mappings`. These are the artifacts that will be published to Maven in the `cdc-microservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar`. Consumers can depend on this archive for the definitions of the service's contract and behaviours. They can use it when testing by having these definitions shape a 'Mock' service.

To export the contracts, use the `publishToMavenLocal` task in gradle:-

```bash
$ gradle publishToMavenLocal
```

As a final check, go to the folder `~/.m2/repository/io/pivotalservices` you should see a `/cdc-microservice/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` folder containing a POM and our stubs.jar file. The date should be just seconds ago.

```bash
$ ls -la
-rw-r--r--  1 benwilcock  staff  2372 13 Dec 11:28 cdc-microservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
-rw-r--r--  1 benwilcock  staff  1034 13 Dec 11:35 cdc-microservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.pom
```

That's it. Our contracts have been used to verify our service and have been exported so that consumers can use them when testing their service interactions.
